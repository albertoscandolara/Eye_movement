# Eye movement exercise
This short exercise focuses on firing animations after some common page interactions (cursor movement, elements click).
cursor move -> eyes follow;
click on left eye -> blink left eye;
click on right eye -> blink left eye;
click everywhere else -> blink both eyes;
idle for too long -> get bored;
